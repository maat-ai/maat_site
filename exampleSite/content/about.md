  title: "How We Do Due Diligence"
  block:
  - title: "Experimental Setting"
    content: "We analyse the experimental setting in which the AI technology was evaluated. This is a critical part of AI due diligence as evaluating a model in an improper setting can yield great performance when in reality little of utility has been learnt by the AI model. At Maat we have selected four key attributes which we investigate: Evaluation Procedure, Statistical Significance, Measured and Unmeasured Confounding. For each facet we have a set of experiments and procedures."

  - title: "AI Model"
    content: "AI is extremely flexible terminology. We delve into the algorithm and determine exactly how good the proposed system is. We assess how state of the art the algorithm is, the degree of innovation contributed by the company (are they a wrapper company?), how their model performs against a simple baseline which Maat will develop internally and the degree of interpretability."
    
  - title: "People"
    content: "As with any company, the people are just as important and often more important than the product that they have created.  The main objective is to assess their level of AI understanding, along with their AI engineering competence. This is achieved through a rigorous  interview process and also conducting our own investigation into their past AI
related achievements (published papers, companies and degrees)."
    
  - title: "Plausibility of Signal"
    content: "It is vital that there is a plausible true signal for the task at hand,as regardless AI will likely find a confounder in the dataset to leverage to yield good results. We check for scientific evidence which demonstrates the presence of a signal and present the referenced findings"
  
  - title: "Code Base"
    content: "A well maintained, efficient and readable code base is critical if AI tech is to provide utility. We evaluate 3 key aspects of the codebase: Integrability, Scalability and Readability."
